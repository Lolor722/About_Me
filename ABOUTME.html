<p>Hello Eveyone, I am Loraine Mae B. Daque, from West Poblacion, Alburquerque, Bohol. 19 years of age and I am Computer Engineering Student from University of Bohol.</p>

<h1> WHAT IS YOUR GUIDING PRINCIPLE IN LIFE? </h1>
<h2>"Principle don't change, people do."</h2>

<p> My guiding principle in life is to be true to myself. It may sometimes mean making unpopular decision, or one that might raise a few eyebrows but I know that if I do as I believe, then right or wrong, I will be able to live with my decision and blame no one else for my mistakes. It is to easy to fall into the trap of being pressured into your decisions or choices especially in our society. I admire those that can and do stand by their own choices and live by them. A similarity is a sameness or alikeness. When you are comparing two things physical objects, ideas, or experiences  you often look at their similarities and their differences.Difference is the opposite of similarity. Both squares and rectangles have four sides, that is a similarity between them.  </p>

<h1>WHAT ARE YOUR GREATEST ACHEIVEMENT IN LIFE?</h1>
<p>“Principle don't change, people do.”
Achievements are the building blocks that enable someone to construct a sense of themselves as a success. The achievements that matter most combine to form a version of success that has meaning and substance for the individual. Achievements also provide tangible evidence that colleagues,competitors and the wider worldAchievements also provide tangible evidence that colleagues, competitors and the wider world use to judge a person as more or less successful. I grew up with my parents. They are the one who looked after me. They serve as my motivation and inspiration to continue achieving my goals and developing myself.</p>

<h1>WHAT ARE YOUR FUTURE PLANS IN LIFE?</h1>
<p> My greatest accomplishment is to be sitting here right now. I believe that life is a constant work in progress and that all moments both monumental and quiet, contribute to who I am. Being true to myself living life on my terms, being a good daughter and citizen, realizing that I have more potential than I thought recovering from my problems or mental breadown, completing my school work, and being able to learn and grow every day. Well, 5 years from now, I will become a Computer Engineer and I will claim that. As I continue on my journey I may face many difficulties, breakdowns and obstacle but I will do whatever it takes to achieve my goals and I will continue to improve, expand my network, purchase my dream house and car, be stable, have my own business and travel.</p>
